# Catona Climate Customer Dashboard: Development & Design Brief

This document summarizes the key objectives, principles, and phased plan for
building Catona Climate's enterprise customer dashboard. The goal is a secure,
scalable, and user‑friendly platform allowing companies to understand and
manage the impact of their carbon credit portfolios.

## Core Theme
"Your Journey to Net‑Zero: Transparent Impact, Tangible Results"

## Guiding Principles
- **User‑Centricity** – interfaces must be intuitive and aligned with client
  goals.
- **Transparency & Trust** – data should be clear, verifiable, and honest.
- **Data‑Driven Storytelling** – present complex data in a compelling, visual
  manner.
- **Sophistication & Professionalism** – modern design reflecting Catona's
  leadership in climate finance.
- **Security by Design** – protect all sensitive information.
- **Scalability & Performance** – plan for growth in users and data volume.
- **Maintainability & Extensibility** – modular code with room for future
  features.
- **Accessibility** – meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards as a minimum.

## Project Phases (High Level)
1. **Discovery & Planning**
   - Gather detailed requirements and user personas.
   - Prioritize features for an MVP using the MoSCoW method.
   - Choose technology stack (e.g., React with TypeScript, FastAPI, PostgreSQL).
2. **Design**
   - Create information architecture, wireframes, and prototypes.
   - Establish a UI kit and visual style guide.
   - Include accessibility considerations from the start.
3. **Backend Development**
   - Implement database schema and API endpoints with strong security.
   - Integrate authentication/authorization via a dedicated identity provider.
   - Build data ingestion pipelines to pull in project data.
4. **Frontend Development**
   - Set up the project architecture with React/Vue and Tailwind CSS.
   - Build reusable components and integrate APIs.
   - Implement responsive, accessible charts and dashboards.
5. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Unit, integration, and end‑to‑end tests across frontend and backend.
   - Performance and security testing prior to launch.
6. **Deployment & Launch**
   - Provision cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines.
   - Conduct pre‑launch checks and deploy to production.
7. **Post‑Launch**
   - Monitor application health and collect user feedback.
   - Perform regular maintenance and iterate on new features.

The success of the dashboard relies on collaboration among Catona stakeholders
and developers, a commitment to quality, and an agile approach that allows for
learning and adaptation throughout the process.
