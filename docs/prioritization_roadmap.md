# Prioritization Roadmap

This document outlines the current order of feature development based on impact and effort.

1. **Inline validation & single‑click editing** – low effort with high impact on usability.
2. **Read‑only styling & tooltips** – clarifies data when editing is disabled.
3. **Sticky Key Metrics & animated chart transitions** – adds visual polish and improves comprehension.
4. **Scenario save/load & export** – provides major value by allowing users to share and revisit models.
5. **Accessibility improvements** – broad benefit and aligns with compliance requirements.
